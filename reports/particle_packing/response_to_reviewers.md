#### Description of data collection

> I feel that one can give a more gentle introduction to an underlying problem of packing simulation here.

Mentioned that we use geometry-based particle packing simulations to generate a set of spheres within a volume and analyze the packing fraction (occupied space vs. total space).

> One can also explain here or below why exactly simulations fail. Is it an underlying property of the algorithm/simulation or of this particular realization that you used? For example, https://github.com/VasiliBaranov/packing-generation uses for the LS algorithm the Verlet lists/cell lists optimization to find relevant particle neighbors quickly, but for very dilute packings it can miss some relevant neighbors, so the algorithm can fail due to missing some relevant neighbors during approximate search. In this case, it is the consequence of implementation.

Mentioned that the algorithm can fail due to missing neighboring particles during an approximate search.

This has been updated for clarity, including an example.

This has been changed to: "For a given parameter set, the probability of a simulation failing is the number of failed simulations divided by the number of simulations that were run. Figure 2 contains the probabilities of a parameter set failing for each of the two algorithms (force-biased and Lubachevskyâ€“Stillinger)."

> Ah, so for each parameter set you track how many simulations you did and what was the corresponding probability of failure? Maybe you can mention this or explain better somehow.

That's correct. This has been updated per the comment above.

> > Figure 3. Histogram of number of simulations vs. packing fraction for the force-biased algorithm or fba (blue) and Lubachevsky-Stillinger or ls algorithm (red). On average, the ls algorithm tends to have higher packing fractions with a more Gaussian-like distribution than fba.

> It is a bit suspicious that the LS algorithm produces packings only above density 0.64, i.e. jammed packings only. Maybe you used the version of the algorithm that is called lsgd in https://github.com/VasiliBaranov/packing-generation It is then slightly different from the pure LS algorithm (the compression rate decreases) and it can be explained a little in the text.

We have updated this to reflect that the algorithms were run in a two-step process: first an attempt to run FBA followed by an attempt to run LS. Even if FBA failed, LS was still attempted. We included a link to the relevant code.

> In general, one could explain the underlying problem here slightly more and may structure the section "Experimental design, materials and methods" to make it easier to follow, I feel.

This has been addressed and the structure updated.

> Also, it would make sense to mention https://github.com/VasiliBaranov/packing-generation in section Experimental design, materials and methods.

This has been added.

> It would also be fair to cite the papers where the code above was introduced and used, e.g. https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/sm/c3sm52959b

This has been referenced.

This has been updated.
